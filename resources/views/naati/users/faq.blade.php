                                    The NAATI CCL (Credentialled Community Language) Test is an assessment that evaluates an
                                    individual's language proficiency at a community level. It involves listening to audio
                                    recordings of dialogues and interpreting or translating them from English to another
                                    language. The test aims to assess language skills in a real-life, community-based
                                    context.

                                    may require a few weeks to a couple of months of focused preparation. This may include
                                    familiarizing yourself with the test format, practicing with sample dialogues,
                                    memorising the vocabulary, and refining translation skills. It's recommended to assess
